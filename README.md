# Playing with Inheritance!

## Testing out the code...

I'm going to not include any `print` calls in my code.

To test stuff, use the Debug Console in VS Code to manually type in (or copy/paste from a nearby text file*) directly into the interpreter.

## P.S.

*If you write a little test script or just a `critter_commands.txt` file, please submit it in a PR!
