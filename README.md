# Playing with Inheritance!

Not all the practices are done in the repo at this point. It's hard to play around with stuff and then commit *one version* but I'm still hoping this repo is handy for showing you the main path to go down :thumbsup:

## Testing out the code...

Now that we are using a PettingZoo class, I feel like I can write a compelling little story so testing will be simpler now. Just run varmint_village.py and customize it to do different stuff!

Here's how I test:

```
~/workspace/critters
$ python3 varmint_village.py
```

and look at the output!

## P.S.

*If you write a little test script or just a `critter_commands.txt` file, please submit it in a PR!
